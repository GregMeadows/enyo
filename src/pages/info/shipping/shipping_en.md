Delivery costs are calculated at checkout, and are additional to the displayed price of the product. Delivery costs may vary depending on the delivery address supplied, and the weight of the overall order.

Orders are usually processed in 1-2 business days. Processing time is not included in estimated delivery times.

Some items, especially customised, have a separate manufacturing lead time. This is clearly stated where relevant, and can vary depending on the item. Manufacturing time is not included in the delivery estimates.

We will make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timescales, though delays may occasionally be inevitable due to unforeseen circumstances. Enyo shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver the products within the estimated timescale.

We offer delivery worldwide, but Enyo is not liable to cover any import duties or taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes.
